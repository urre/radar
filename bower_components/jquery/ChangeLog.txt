New and Noteworthy
-----------------

1.1
-----

* Massive speed-ups (4x-10x) in the selector engine.
* You can now unbind event handlers from within themselves
* Added new .one( "type", fn ) method
* text(String) now escapes HTML
* Added attr(String,Function) to calculate the value
* Performming .click(), .blur(), .focus(), .submit() will actually trigger the browsers default action for those events.
* Added global settings for AJAX (in addition to timeout), use $.ajaxSetup() to modify them
* Implemented a better error handling for ajax requests. Exceptions caused by dropping connections are now handled, too.
* Improved event fixing (Opera provides event.srcElement, must ignore it if target is available; only create pageX if clientX is available)

* Fixed nth-child selectors to start on the right number
* jQuery is no longer destructive. Doing var a = $("a"); a.find("span"); does not change the original "a" variable.
* Fixed synchronous requests
* Fixed ID with context selectors (eg. div #id doesn't ignore "div" anymore)

* Fixed docs for html(): Now mentions that is not available for XML documents
* Improved AJAX docs (eg. more examples for $.ajax)
* Documented filter(Function), a very powerful approach for custom filtering
* Improved docs for FX module, merging method descriptions and marking optional arguments
* Improved docs for append, prepend, before and after, merging the three pairs into one
* Improved show/hide animations to show only hidden and hide only visible elements

* Removed .oneEvent() and .unEvent() helper methods.
* Removed all CSS helper methods.
* Removed most attribute helper methods.
* Removed the (undocumented) .find( "selector", fn ) for all destructive methods.

* $.get, $.getIfModified, $.post, $.getScript and $.getJSON now all pass through the XMLHttpRequest as returned by $.ajax

1.0.4
-----

 - Tons of bug fixes
 - Extensions to $.ajax: $.ajax accepts additonal options: beforeSend, async and processData; returns XMLHttpRequest to allow manual aborting of requests, see docs for details
 - AJAX module: the public $.ajax API is now used internally (for $.get/$.post etc.); loading scripts works now much more reliable on all browers except Safari
 - New global ajax handler: ajaxSend - called before an ajax request is sent
 - Extensions to global ajax handlers: ajaxSend, ajaxSuccess, ajaxError and ajaxComplete get XMLHttpRequest and settings passed as arguments
 - Extensions to event handling: pageX and pageY are available x-browser (IE does not provide native pageX/Y)
 - Improved docs: $(String) method has now two seperate descriptions, one for selecting elements, one for creating (html on-the-fly)
 - FX module: Most inline stlyes added by animations are now removed when the animation is complete, eg. height style when animating height (exception: display styles)
 - Added note to attr(String, Object) about issues with setting the name property on input elements
 - Seperated internal stuff from get() into set()
 - Merged the two API examples for each() into one more precise example
 - Improved docs for $.browser and added docs for $.boxModel
 - Docs for the jQuery constructor $() were improved: There is now $(String expression[, Object context]) and $(String html)
